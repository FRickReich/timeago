= timeago  
  
to use this gem, just require and run it, like this:  
  
==== Example 1  
  
> require 'timeago'  
> time = Time.now - 60    
> Timeago.readable(time)    
  
and it should output  
> one minute ago  
  
==== Example 2  
  
> require 'timeago'   
> time = Time.now - 13250  
> Timeago.readable(time)  
  
this should output  
> 3 hours ago  
  
this can go up to 5 years ago, after that it will change to the exact date.
